# Upgrade from v4 to v5

vite-plugin-react-pages v5 is released with following improvements:

- Upgrade vite to [v5](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html).
- Upgrade mdx to [v3](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v3/).

Most migration is done inside this plugin. And our upstream libraries (vite and mdx) did't bring many significant breaking changes. So it should be **very easy** for our users to migrate! The following article will show you the migrate instructions.

If you encounter problems, open an issue in the repo. Or checkout the [getting-stated templates](https://vitejs.github.io/vite-plugin-react-pages/#getting-stated) for working setup.

## Upgrade Node.js to 18+

As [vite v5](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html) required, you should upgrade Node.js to 18+.

## Upgrade project dependencies

Upgrade these package versions:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.0.12",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.2.1",
    "vite-plugin-react-pages": "^5.0.0",
    "vite-pages-theme-doc": "^5.0.0",
    "@mdx-js/react": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

> you can replace `@vitejs/plugin-react` with latest version of `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`.

## Check Upstream libraries migration 

Most migration is done inside this plugin. Although the upstream libraries (vite and mdx) did't bring many significant breaking changes for you, you should still take a look on their migration guides:

- [vite v5](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html)
- [mdx v3](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v3/)
